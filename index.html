      <h1>All systems go to blast your web apps out of this world with Meteor?</h1>

      <p>Announcing the Mastering Meteor.js class - a comprehensive multi-session 8 hour online class that walks you through building a Meteor.js app from scratch.</p>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <p>Ok, all cheesiness aside. You're overwhelmed. Maybe you installed meteor.js and created a new project. But where do you go after that? Should you build a small sample app to learn the platform? Where can you find info or tutorials to help get started?</p>

    <h2>You just aren't sure where to go next with Meteor.js.</h2>

    <p>Let me guess, you watched the intro videos showing off Meteor? But like the 'building a weblog in 15 minutes video' for rails, it was a great short demo that left you with no instructions on the next steps.</p>

    <p>While the Meteor community is great, it sucks to get in IRC and ask questions only to get crickets in response. Posting to stackoverflow is always a gamble too, will someone be kind enough to pay attention to your questions and answer them? Will a true expert reply to your questions?</p>

    <h2>I once heard those crickets <em>too</em>.</h2>

    <p>Looking back at the first app I built in Meteor, it is clear now how little I understood the platform. After spending 15 months building over 40 apps for clients, I've learned a lot about the Meteor platform.</p>

    <p>I wasn't sure the right way to organize my files, or how best to handle a compound join publication while making it reactive. My code was littered with session varaibles everywhere. I knew if I kept learning, my code would improve - I just wish someone was there to guide me.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2><strong>Presenting</strong>: The guidance I needed two years ago</h2>

    <p>In the Mastering Meteor class you will learn how to organize your files, build database collections, hook up pub/sub, handle the accounts packages and add permissions to data, write reactive front end code, and create advanced reactive join publications.</p>

    <p>This course is a series of 4 intense 2-hour workshops that cover how to build a completely functional Meteor.js app from nothing.</p>

    <h2>In mere hours, you'll gain the skills you <em>need</em> to build Meteor apps</h2>

    <p>What's really special about this class is that it's not pre-recorded or heavily scripted. It's live. It's real.</p>

    <p>I won't just talk about the features of Meteor.js, I'll show you how I build each part of an app. The online class is kept intentionally small, with only 10 students, so that we can stop and talk about what we are building and why we approach the code that way.</p>

    <p>You will walk away from this class understanding the core concepts of Meteor.js and how to put them to use building your own reactive web apps.</p>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>Josh Owens is the proprietor of crater.io, host of the meteor podcast, and the open source czar that helped create over 10 meteor packages and 40 meteor.js apps in 12 months time. He's also the author of the Testing with Meteor book and part of the velocity core team, helping to make testing more practical with Meteor. When he is not writing, podcasting, or teaching then you can find him running the Cincinnati Meteor meetup or helping people out with Meteor.js over Airpair.</p>

    <h3>What else do you get?</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>8 hours of interactive discussion and instruction using Google hangout</li>
    <li>A recording of your live class so you can refer back to it in the future</li>
    <li>Access to the Github repo that has the app we built in class</li>
    <li>A copy of The Discover Meteor book by Sacha Greif &amp; Tom Coleman</li>
    <li>Access to the alumni mailing list where myself and other mentors are around to talk and help</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Space is limited</h3>

    <p>Quit wishing you had the time or resources, it’s right here. In designing this course I was determined to create a lean timeline packed with the information you needed to hit the ground coding. I guarantee this will be a hands-on experience where you will learn and get to ask the questions that matter to you, or your money back. That’s right, love it or get your money back. There’s no risk except for missing out on the next session.</p>

    <p>With only ten seats available on a first-come/first-serve basis you won’t want to wait. The tuition for the class and all the focused attention you get is <strong>currently $499.</strong></p>
